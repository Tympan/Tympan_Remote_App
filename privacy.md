## Privacy Policy

This app uses Bluetooth, which on an Android device means that the app must have access to your location while you're using it.  This app does not store your location.  It does not send your location anywhere.

The goal of this app is to allow Bluetooth communication with an Arduino device with a BC127 bluetooth chip - that's it.
